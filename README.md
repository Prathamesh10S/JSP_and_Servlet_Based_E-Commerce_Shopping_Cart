# JSP_and_Servlet_Based_E-Commerce_Shopping_Cart:
This repository contains a fully functional E-Commerce Shopping Cart web application built using JSP, Servlets, and MySQL for backend data storage. The application allows users to browse products, add items to the shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. Admin users can manage products, categories, and view orders.

# About:
This e-commerce shopping cart system is built as a web application using JSP (Java Server Pages) and Servlets. The system supports user registration, product browsing, adding items to the cart, and secure checkout functionality. The backend uses MySQL to store product, order, and user information.

The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where:

-Servlets act as the controllers, handling business logic and requests.
-JSP is used for the view layer, rendering dynamic content.
-MySQL is the database to store persistent data.

# Technologies Used:
1)Java (JSP & Servlets): Core logic and request handling.
2)MySQL: Database for storing user, product, and order information.
3)JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.
4)HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: Frontend UI/UX for a clean and responsive interface.
5)Apache Tomcat: Used as the web server for running the application.
